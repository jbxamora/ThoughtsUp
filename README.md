# ThoughtsUp

ThoughtsUp is a social network API built using Express.js and MongoDB, which can handle large amounts of unstructured data. It offers a variety of features such as sharing thoughts, reacting to friend’s thoughts, and creating a friend list. It’s a great solution for social media startups as it offers flexibility in terms of data structure and handles large amounts of data effectively. It also offers API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to enable users to interact with the database, and the Mongoose ODM is used for database modeling. ThoughtsUp is perfect for developers looking to build social network APIs and require scalability and flexibility in their data structure.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Code Snippets

### Date Formatting

This code exports a function that takes in a timestamp and an options object with properties monthLength and dateSuffix.
The function formats the timestamp into a readable string format using the options provided.

If the monthLength is set to `short`, the abbreviated month name is used in the format, otherwise the full month name is used.

If `dateSuffix` is true, the day of the month is appended with a suffix like `st`, `nd`, `rd`, or `th`.

The function first creates an object of month names based on the `monthLength` option provided, then creates a new `Date` object from the timestamp, and finally formats the date into a string using string concatenation.

```js
// Function to format a timestamp
module.exports = (
  timestamp,
  { monthLength = "short", dateSuffix = true } = {}
) => {
  let months;

  if (monthLength === "short") {
    months = {
      0: "Jan",
      1: "Feb",
      2: "Mar",
      3: "Apr",
      4: "May",
      5: "Jun",
      6: "Jul",
      7: "Aug",
      8: "Sep",
      9: "Oct",
      10: "Nov",
      11: "Dec",
    };
  } else {
    months = {
      0: "January",
      1: "February",
      2: "March",
      3: "April",
      4: "May",
      5: "June",
      6: "July",
      7: "August",
      8: "September",
      9: "October",
      10: "November",
      11: "December",
    };
  }

  const dateObj = new Date(timestamp);
  const formattedMonth = months[dateObj.getMonth()];

  let dayOfMonth;

  if (dateSuffix) {
    dayOfMonth = addDateSuffix(dateObj.getDate());
  } else {
    dayOfMonth = dateObj.getDate();
  }

  const year = dateObj.getFullYear();

  let hour;
  // Check for 24-hr time
  if (dateObj.getHours > 12) {
    hour = Math.floor(dateObj.getHours() / 2);
  } else {
    hour = dateObj.getHours();
  }
  // If hour is 0 (12:00am), change it to 12
  if (hour === 0) {
    hour = 12;
  }

  const minutes = dateObj.getMinutes();

  // Set `am` or `pm`
  let periodOfDay;

  if (dateObj.getHours() >= 12) {
    periodOfDay = "pm";
  } else {
    periodOfDay = "am";
  }

  const formattedTimeStamp = `${formattedMonth} ${dayOfMonth}, ${year} at ${hour}:${minutes} ${periodOfDay}`;

  return formattedTimeStamp;
};
```

### Seeds

This is an asynchronous function in JavaScript that is responsible for seeding the MongoDB database with data.

The function first removes any existing data for the `Thoughts` and `User` models using the Mongoose's `deleteMany()` method.
It then creates new data for these models using the Mongoose's `create()` method with the data defined in the thoughts and users arrays.

After creating the new data, the function associates the thoughts with the users by iterating through the `createdThoughts` array and finding the user with the matching username.

It pushes the `thought._id` into the user's thoughts array and saves the user. Finally, the function logs a success message to the console and disconnects from the database.

```js
const seedData = async () => {
  try {
    // Remove any existing data
    await Thought.deleteMany({});
    await User.deleteMany({});

    // Create the new data
    const createdUsers = await User.create(users);
    const createdThoughts = await Thought.create(thoughts);

    // Associate the thoughts with the users
    for (let i = 0; i < createdThoughts.length; i++) {
      const thought = createdThoughts[i];
      const user = createdUsers.find(
        (user) => user.username === thought.username
      );
      user.thoughts.push(thought._id);
      await user.save();
    }

    console.log("Data seeding successful!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error seeding data:", error.message);
  } finally {
    // Disconnect from the database
    mongoose.disconnect();
  }
};
```
